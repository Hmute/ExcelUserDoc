# Creating a Chart

## Overview

In this section, we will explore another basic use of Excel: Creating a Chart, and this is a follow up tutorial to the previous tutorial: [Creating a budget](Task1.md). Also, we will work with seperate sheets to seperate data and organize the project

## Getting started

1. Click on the plus sign on the bottom left of the page to add a new sheet:
![Task2 Image](Assets/Task2/Task2_1.png)

2. Right click on the ”Sheet1” that is on the left of the bottom bar, click “Rename” and rename it to “Expected”:
![Task2 Image](Assets/Task2/Task2_2A.png)
![Task2 Image](Assets/Task2/Task2_2B.png)
 Expected label means in the previous worksheet, we are inputting the amount you are expecting to spend on a certain item.

3. Right click on the “Sheet2” that is on the left of the bottom bar and click “Rename” and rename it to “Actual”:
![Task2 Image](Assets/Task2/Task2_3.png)  
Actual label means in this worksheet, the actual amount that you have spent on the set item.

4. From the “Expected” Sheet, click and drag over the label’s of the table made from the previous table, besides “Total” and its number. Copy and paste it to A1 on “Actual” Sheet:
![Task2 Image](Assets/Task2/Task2_4.png)
![Task2 Image](Assets/Task2/Task2_4B.png)  
You are only supposed to copy the labels, not the numbers, we will be filling with hypothetical data.

5. Fill the Table of the “Actual” Sheet  under their respective labels:
![Task2 Image](Assets/Task2/Task2_5.png)  
This represents the actual cost of the items that you previously budgeted from.


6. Format the Data for the desired currency, as previously explained in task 1:
![Task2 Image](Assets/Task2/Task2_6.png)  
Should be the same currency as the currency previously used (link to task of currency)

7. Click and drag the Mouse Over the Complete Table:
![Task2 Image](Assets/Task2/Task2_7.png)

8. Click on the “Insert” Tab in the navigation Bar On the Top of the program:
![Task2 Image](Assets/Task2/Task2_8.png)
![Task2 Image](Assets/Task2/Task2_8B.png)

9. Click over The picture of “Line Chart” and choose The first Option Under “2-D Line”:
![Task2 Image](Assets/Task2/Task2_9A.png)
![Task2 Image](Assets/Task2/Task2_9B.png)

10. Rename The Chart “Chart Title” to “Actual Expenses” by double clicking on the title:
![Task2 Image](Assets/Task2/Task2_10.png)
![Task2 Image](Assets/Task2/Task2_10B.png)

11. Press Ctrl + S and Save the File

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to create a chart in Excel. This is a useful tool to visualize data and make it easier to understand. We have also learned how to work with multiple sheets in Excel, which can help organize data and make it easier to manage large projects.

On the next tutorial, we will learn how to create a [CheckList](Task3.md) in Excel.
