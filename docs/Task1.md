# Creating a Budget

## overview

In this section, we will explore the basic use of Excel: entering data in the cells, applying certain functions on them based on their data type, such as SUM function for numbers, and creating a table on the entries. 

a cell is the intersection point of a row and a column, forming a box where you can enter, manipulate, and format data. Cells are the basic building blocks of a worksheet and can contain individual data points, formulas, or functions that process and display information.

## Getting started

We will be creating a hypothetical budget to give you a general idea of how Excel can be used. 

1. Click on "Blank workbook" to create a new worksheet:
![Task1 Image](Assets/Task1/Task1_1A.png)
You should be on "Home" section to access "Blank workbook"
 

2. Label the cells on row 1 from B1 the months of a year in order:
![Task1 Image](Assets/Task1/Task1_2.png)
Since We will be creating a budget, we will use months of the year as labels per column. We start at cell B1, because we next an extra space at column A for other labels in it.

3. Click on cell A2 to label any expense:

In this example, we are labeling 6 columns to A7 as we have 6 expenses to work with. We start at A2, because per column in A, we want an empty cell between it and other letter columns. In our case, we are aligning A columns with columns B to M.

4. Enter number next to expense(s) under months to display how much is spent per month on the labeled expense(s):

We will use numbers as inputs to convey  how much is spent on expense(s) under the give months. For example, we have "Groceries" as one our expenses and have 400 in Jan, 350 in Feb to 400 in december.

5. Click on cell O1 and label it "Total":

The purpose of this step is to sum the number entries, which are expenses per month. We chose cell O1 to make spaces between the Total label and other labels. You should always have a distance of at least one column between the data added and the result.

6. Enter "=sum(" under "Total" cell:

7. Click and drag the mouse over the numbers, then hit enter to sum how much is spent on expense(s) over time:
![Task1 Image](Assets/Task1/Task1_7.png)
![Task1 Image](Assets/Task1/Task1_7B.png)
Doing this will gather all the numbers to be summed. SUM function only works with numerical values.

8. Click and drag the mouse over the table and press ALT + H:

9. Press B:

10. Press T:

11. Click the dollar icon($) under the "Number" sub section of the "Home" tab, Between "Alignment", and "Styles":
![Task1 Image](Assets/Task1/Task1_10B.png)
In order to display currency as format of the number entries, we will be formatting our entries to currency.


12. Press CTRL + S, label the "File name" "budget" and click "Save" to save:
