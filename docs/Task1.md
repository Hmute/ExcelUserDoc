# Creating a Budget

## Overview

In this section, we will explore the very basic use of Excel: entering data in the [cells](Glossary.md), applying certain [functions](Glossary.md) on them based on their data type, such as SUM [function](Glossary.md) for numbers, creating a [table](Glossary.md) on the entries and formatting them. 

## Getting started

We will be creating a hypothetical budget to give you a general idea of how Excel can be used. 

1. Click on "Blank workbook" to create a new worksheet:
![Task1 Image](Assets/Task1/Task1_1A.png)  
    * You should be on "Home" section to access "Blank workbook"
 

2. Label the [cells](Glossary.md) from [row](Glossary.md) 1 starting at [column](Glossary.md) B onward with the months of the year:
![Task1 Image](Assets/Task1/Task1_2.png)  
    * This sets up a clear timeline in this instance of creating a budget
    * [Column](Glossary.md) A is left blank for additional categories or labels as needed
    * We're labeling cells with all the months of the year; however, you can customize this based on your needs, such as only labeling through April if that suits your project.

3. Click and label [cells](Glossary.md) from [row](Glossary.md) 2 in [column](Glossary.md) A to label any expense:
![Task1 Image](Assets/Task1/Task1_3.png)  
    * We’re using [rows](Glossary.md) 2 to 7 for six expense categories, ensuring there’s a one-column gap to the right for a cleaner separation from the monthly labels in [columns](Glossary.md) B to M.
    

4. Enter your monthly expenses under the corresponding month:
![Task1 Image](Assets/Task1/Task1_4.png)  
    * For instance, if you spent $400 on groceries in January, enter '400' in the cell under 'Jan' next to 'Groceries'.

5. Click on [cell](Glossary.md) at [row](Glossary.md) 1 [column](Glossary.md) O and label it "Total":
![Task1 Image](Assets/Task1/Task1_5.png)  
    * This step is for totaling the monthly expenses. We use [cell](Glossary.md) at [row](Glossary.md) 1 [column](Glossary.md) O for the 'Total' label to maintain a clear separation from the monthly data, ensuring there's at least one blank [column](Glossary.md) as for easy distinction.

## Applying [Function](Glossary.md)

!!! note "Info"
    <i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> [Function](Glossary.md) can only be applied to the data of the same data type. For instance, "SUM" [function](Glossary.md) in Excel can only be applied to numbers.

6. Enter "=sum(" under "Total" [cell](Glossary.md):
![Task1 Image](Assets/Task1/Task1_6.png)

7. Click and drag the mouse over the numbers, then hit enter to sum how much is spent on expense(s) over time:
![Task1 Image](Assets/Task1/Task1_7.png)
![Task1 Image](Assets/Task1/Task1_7B.png)
    * Doing this will gather all the numbers to be summed. Again, SUM [function](Glossary.md) only works with numerical values.

## Creating a [Table](Glossary.md)
8. Click and drag the mouse over the table and press ALT + H:

9. Press B:

10. Press T:
![Task1 Image](Assets/Task1/Task1_10A.png)
![Task1 Image](Assets/Task1/Task1_9B.png)

## [Formatting](Glossary.md) the data

We will [format](Glossary.md) the number data into currency as our example in this tutorial deals with a budget.

11. Click and drag over the number data and click the dollar icon($) under the "Number" sub  section of the "Home" tab, Between "Alignment", and "Styles":
![Task1 Image](Assets/Task1/Task1_10B.png)  
    * In order to display currency as [format](Glossary.md) of the number entries, we will be formatting our entries to currency.


12. Press CTRL + S, label the "File name" "budget" and click "Save" to save:
![Task1 Image](Assets/Task1/Task1_11.png)  
    * We are naming the file "budget", but you can choose your desired name for it.
